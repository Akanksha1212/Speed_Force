A car crash reporting tool for your emergency contact and nearby users

The main premise of this tool is to first detect a crash and to inform your designated emergency contact person that a possible crash has occured. While similar tools exsist, by using the nearby contacts adds something new to the equation. The app would concurently send a prompt to nearby users informing them of a possible accident nearby and if they are willing to assist.
