A car crash reporting tool for your emergency contact and nearby users

**Speed Force** purpose is to detect a crash and to inform your designated emergency contact person that a possible crash has occurred. While similar tools exist, to our knowledge the nearby contacts feature is not incorporated.

Speed Force will send a prompt to nearby users informing them of a possible accident nearby and if they are willing to assist, in addition to the emergency contact.
  
This tool is meant to be used in a community setting to support each other. Maybe at a busy intersection with local business or a sport team traveling, or maybe just getting groceries for loved ones.
